⭐ PROBLEM STATEMENT

The justice system continues to struggle with deep-rooted operational inefficiencies that delay the delivery of justice. Key challenges include:

1️⃣ Increasing Case Backlogs

An ever-growing volume of pending cases overwhelms courts, resulting in prolonged trials and delayed verdicts.

2️⃣ Manual & Fragmented Administrative Workflows

Processes such as filing, documentation, and case updates are still largely manual, reducing overall efficiency and increasing chances of error.

3️⃣ Time-Consuming Legal Research

Identifying relevant laws, precedents, and judgments requires extensive manual effort, slowing down case preparation significantly.

4️⃣ Lack of Efficient Case Tracking Mechanisms

Stakeholders often lack real-time visibility into case progression, upcoming hearings, and necessary actions—leading to unnecessary delays.

5️⃣ Insufficient Digital Tools for Dispute Resolution

Limited access to online mediation and negotiation platforms further burdens the court system by pushing avoidable cases into traditional litigation.
