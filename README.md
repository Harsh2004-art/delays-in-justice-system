Technology can play a major role in reducing delays in the justice system by improving efficiency at every stage of the case cycle. Digital case management systems help courts track cases, schedule hearings, and access files instantly, reducing paperwork and administrative bottlenecks. E-filing allows lawyers and citizens to submit documents online, saving time and preventing manual errors. AI-powered legal research tools enable judges and lawyers to quickly find relevant precedents and laws, cutting down the time spent on traditional research. Virtual hearings through video conferencing make it easier for all parties to attend without delays caused by travel or scheduling conflicts. Additionally, Online Dispute Resolution platforms offer faster settlements for minor civil cases without needing to enter crowded courts. By automating routine tasks like document sorting, notification sending, and case summarization, technology allows court staff to focus on critical work. Altogether, these tools streamline processes, reduce workload, and significantly help clear case backlogs.
