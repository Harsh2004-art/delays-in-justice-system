                <h3>1. Huge Backlog</h3>
                <p>
                    Lakhs of cases are pending for years at different levels of courts,
                    putting pressure on judges and staff.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card soft">
                <h3>2. Manual Paperwork</h3>
                <p>
                    Physical files, handwritten notes, and manual registers slow down filing,
                    tracking, and updating cases.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card soft">
                <h3>3. Slow Case Tracking</h3>
                <p>
                    Parties struggle to know the exact status of their case, next hearing date,
                    or previous orders easily.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card soft">
                <h3>4. Frequent Adjournments</h3>
                <p>
                    Hearings are postponed repeatedly due to lack of coordination, absence
                    of parties, or missing documents.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card soft">
                <h3>5. No Smart Reminders</h3>
                <p>
                    There are no automatic reminders for upcoming hearings for lawyers,
                    parties, or even staff.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card soft">
                <h3>6. Poor Use of Technology</h3>
                <p>
                    Many courts still depend on manual systems instead of digital dashboards
                    and automated workflows.

        <div class="card highlight">
            <h3>Impact on Citizens</h3>
            <p>
                Because of these problems, cases take longer to finish, citizens lose trust,
                and the principle of “Justice delayed is justice denied” becomes a reality.
